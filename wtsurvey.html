            <h3>The Survey:</h3>
            <p style="text-indent:1%">
                The survey entitled "Freshman AP Class Opinions" was taken by Owen Gray (the creator of this website).<br>
              It documented the opinions of Western Tech students on AP classes as well as how available AP classes were<br>
              to WT students. It revealed that most students received zero AP class options in Freshman year and that those<br>
              who did received the AP class option as a requirement as part of their magnet course. It also showed that the<br>
              majority of students wish they had more AP course options and feel they would benefit from their GT classes<br>
              instead being AP classes. Additionally, the students have been proven ready based of the 100% 4.0 GPAs found<br>
              on the survey. The only AP student found their class very enjoyable.
