                The goal of this website is to educate people about the benefits of AP classes -- especially as lower classmen -- and discuss some of the restrictions being placed on Freshmen. While it is unlikely
                that anything will actually come of this, some potential goals would include:<br>
                    - More AP class availability for freshmen, especially those at Western Tech<br>
                    - More education about the benefits of AP classes<br>
                    - More students being aware of their AP options in the future -- especially those who in the past have been discouraged from taking higher-level classes<br>
