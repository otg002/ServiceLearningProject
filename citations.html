                    The article presents a graph displaying how increased AP exams and classes, <br>
                    especially scores of 3 or higher, have a deeply close relationship with <br>
                    success in institutions like 4-year colleges. They use methods like analyzing <br>
                    3 cohorts of highschool students to gather good data. It proves that AP classes<br>
                    are beneficial for students, even if they only take one.

                    A breif statement to summarize the article would be "AP classes are incredibly <br>
                    beneficial to students". They make you stand out favorably to colleges, <br>
                    positively impact your readiness to do well in university, and increase graduation <br>
                    rates for those who do well in those classes. Additionally, AP credits received<br>
                    from AP courses can be used to speed up graduation requirements for university, <br>
                    leading to a decreased cost for higher education. These scores also have an effect <br>
                    on universities across the globe. This source is a primary source providing <br>
                    information directly from the creators of AP about the benefits of AP. The author's <br>
                    information is on an official site, meaning that they are highly unlikely to get <br>
                    facts about their own contents wrong. They are however, biased towards AP, as it <br>
                    is their classes being promoted. The source clearly discusses benefits that could <br>
                    also apply to freshmen if given the opportunity. This source will serve as useful <br>
                    evidence to promote why freshmen would benefit from a greater availability of AP <br>
                    classes by demonstrating how all individuals benefit from that increased availability.

                    This post made by AP Central (a division of College Board) provides a short statement <br>
                    about the benefits of AP classes for high school freshmen. It discusses how AP classes <br>
                    for freshmen and sophmores can provide more time to think about colleges and careers <br>
                    in the future as well as a greater opportunity to earn college credit, therefore <br>
                    leading to more success in colleges. It also provides a list of classes that are highly<br>
                    recommended for freshmen taking AP for the first time: AP Human Geography, AP World History:<br>
                    Modern, AP European History, AP Seminar, AP Computer Science Principles, and AP World <br>
                    Language and Culture courses. This is another source coming from the creators of AP, <br>
                    so they know what they're talking about. It is based on data they have abundant access <br>
                    to and includes testimony from former AP students going on to be successful at the college<br>
                    level (being able to pursue a Master's and a Bachelor's within just four years of college).<br>
                    This is a perfect example of strong evidence that freshmen can be successful in AP <br>
                    classes and would most definitely benefits from a high level of access to AP classes.

                    This is a survey documenting the following results: approximately 85% of students surveyed<br>
                    were offered zero classes in freshman year. The remaining ~15% was only one student. Two<br>
                    thirds of the students wish they had more options for AP classes this year and 83% think<br>
                    they would benefit from their GT classes being AP instead of GT. The remaining 17% was not<br>
                    a "No" but instead a "Mixed" between some being AP and some being GT. 100% of the students<br>
                    in AP classes said it was an enjoyable and beneficial experience. Out of the students in GT,<br>
                    100% found the classes easy and were consistently receiving straight A's. This source was <br>
                    created by the author of this presentation (Owen Gray) and is a primary source reflecting <br>
                    opinions at the school in question (Western Tech). It is thus very trustworthy and very <br>
                    relevant. As it is a survey, the only bias comes from the participants, who were mostly higher<br>
                    level students than an average sample of the student population here at Western. This is a <br>
                    relevant showing of how many of Western's GT students would benefit from AP classes and how <br>
                    very little opportunities have been given to participate in them. The one AP class taken by <br>
                    the one AP student surveyed was a part of their magnet program, meaning it wasn't even an <br>
                    academic opportunity as much as simply a college credit when there otherwise wouldn't be one. <br>
                    This is excellent evidence regarding the point this presentation is attempting to make.

                    A study conducted in Texas on students that took AP in their first two years of high school when<br>
                    compared with students that didn't, specifically studying students in both groups that had been<br>
                    labelled academically disadvantaged, showed that students who had taken AP in their first two<br>
                    years had a number of benefits towards their future; these include but are not limited to a nearly<br>
                    50% increase in the likelihood of taking secondary education immediately following high school,<br>
                    a substantial increase in the rate of taking four-year colleges rather than two-year colleges,<br>
                    and a higher likelihood of earning the desired degrees of the respective students within four to<br>
                    six years. The study then goes on to suggest that schools should not make academic histories of <br>
                    students the main factor of determining preparedness of students for AP success and classes, <br>
                    especially in the first two years of high school. This is supported by the studies finding of <br>
                    substantial benefits of taking AP classes for students labelled academically prepared within these<br>
                    years. This source is a credible source found on ERIC, a government site run by the department of<br>
                    education. It is a primary source with data taken for this purpose and is rigorously defended from<br>
                    potential bias in the results of the analysis by employing several techniques to prevent and <br>
                    identify bias. The study shows that AP classes can be beneficial even to those whose academic <br>
                    histories of grades and standardized test scores were poor. It relevantly emphasizes the importance<br>
                    of AP availability especially within the first two years of high school.
