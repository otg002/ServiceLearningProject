                  AP classes have a number of proven benefits. These include the ability to earn<br>
                college-credits, reducing the amount of money and time you have to spend if you<br>
                choose to attend a university. Additionally, students who attend AP classes are<br>
                more likely to do well in college and higher-level classes even if the students<br>
                taking the AP class are those who typically receive lower test scores and would<br>
                be considered 'academically disadvantaged'. This especially applies to the first<br>
                two years of highschool. AP classes also make you stand out positively to colleges<br>
                during applications. Finally, AP classes prepare you for college-level classes<br>
                so that you can have a more successful experience in the future.
