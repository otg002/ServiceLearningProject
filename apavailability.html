                  The study on Western Tech students—detailed further on its dedicated page—revealed<br>
                that most freshmen at WT had little to no access to AP. This coupled with the benefits<br>
                of AP, especially for lower-classmen and 'academically disadvantaged' students shows<br>
                that this is a mistake. It is depriving freshmen of rich oportunities for growth and<br>
                improvement as well as underestimating them by assuming they cannot handle college-level<br>
                classes for little reason aside from age. This as well as the fact that AP classes *used*<br>
                to be offered at Western Tech for freshmen (Noah Gray has testified that he had at least<br>
                one AP class freshman year) leads to the seemingly obvious point that AP classes should<br>
                be made more available to freshmen in the future.
